# TwitterQueryer

Is it spelled "Querier"? Oops?

This will take requests from my ThatsTwinteresting project and execute a Twitter search query from that request. i may use this piece to do the actual work of saving queries to PI.

## Building

Just open the project in Visual Studio and get going. This project may requeire some other small apps i'm building... but it's still early and i'll figure it out.
