{"name":"ThatsTwinteresting","body":"# ThatsTwinteresting\r\n\r\nThis is a fun project built during the 2012 ConnectedWorld Magazine's Hackathon. i competed in the OSI track.\r\n\r\nYeah i know, it's the best name ever.\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nThis web app and background service save Twitter queries away in [PI AF](http://www.osisoft.com/software-support/what-is-pi/What_Is_PI.aspx) in order to save those tweets (since Twitter's API doesn't give you data older that 6-9 days). It builds up a database surrounding your queries and then lets the user sort through that data.\r\n\r\n## Building and running\r\n\r\nThis project requires OSIsoft's PI database with access to an AF Server. That's the hard part... if you dont have one already, or don't know about it, then you may want to let this one pass.\r\n\r\n1. Set up AF\r\n  1. Create an AF Database for this application (Optional)\r\n  1. Import the Element Template file into your AF Database\r\n  2. Import the EventFrame Template file into your AF Database\r\n2. Open the top level solution and build it\r\n3. Set the command line parameters for each project (they're both the same)\r\n  1. PISystem Name\r\n  2. The application's AF Database Name\r\n  3. User name for PISystem connection (optional)\r\n  4. Password for PISystem connection (optional)\r\n\r\ni've put in a lot of work to make it as easy as possible to build and run out of the gate. If i'm missing something or it doesn't work for you, i beg you to let me know! There's github issues or you can tweet me [@jugglingnutcase](https://twitter.com/jugglingnutcase).\r\n\r\n## Open Source\r\n\r\ni used a few open source libraries to get a few things done faster:\r\n* [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) - Thank goodness for this library! Imagine if i had to roll my own HTML and CSS. Yuck.\r\n* [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org) - An easy to use .NET web framework. It's so simple and with tons of hosting options. The main developers are nice to boot :)\r\n* [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/) - A .NET REST API i use for making calls to Twitter's API.\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 James Sconfitto\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the [Ms-PL](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/ThatsTwinteresting/blob/master/license).\r\n","tagline":"Because the world doesnt have enough Twitter apps with punny names...","google":"UA-537179-12","note":"Don't delete this file!
