# ThatsTwinteresting

Yeah, it's the best name ever. i know.

This is a fun project built for the ConnectedWorld Magazine Hackathon. It will save a Twitter query away and build up a database of tweets surrounding that query and then let the user see what has been building up over time.

## Building

Just open the project in Visual Studio and get going. This project may requeire some other small apps i'm building... but it's still early and i'll figure it out.
